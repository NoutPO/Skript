Skripts List:

  -HomeFees
    With home fees you can make homes but it will cost you money (price can be changed in the skript) also the max amount of homes can be changed (change to 0 for infinity amount), by typing /home <name> you will be teleported to this home with a fee (default price is 2 x distance away from home)
      commands:
        -/sethome [<name>] 
              home fees can be changed
              max homes can be changed
        -/delhome [<name>]
        -/homelist
        -/home [<name>]
  
  -Calculator
    with the calculator you can calculate al lot of thing! currently I only made the 4 opperators +, -, * and /. The way you calculate 
    something is with /calc or /calculator, for example I want to calculate 1 + 1:
  
  I type: /calc 1 then /calc + then /calc 1 and at last /calc =. it will send the answer in chat and it will send you and action bar.   
  To calculate something else just type /calc reset with the equation.
  
  with /toggleloop you can turn on and off the feature that it constantly sends the equation to anyone who is currently calculating 
  something (This command can only be used by operators). It does not creat much lag, but if it does you can just turn it off with 
  /toggleloop
      commands:
        -/calc or /calculator (explanation above)
        -/toggleloop (permission: op) (explanation above)
